A React App that can detect faces in your images.

You can either create an account or login with the email "admin@gmail.com" and the password "test".

*Note: I recommend to login with the above credentials as this project uses a deprecated version of bcrypt node.js*

>If you're going to make an account the email validation doesn't check if the email exists so you can use anything you want as long as it hasn't already been entered before. *ex* "qwejhyu@example.com" will work.
